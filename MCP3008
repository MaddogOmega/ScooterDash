# This is out of Raspberry Pi cookbook by "Simon Monk" with some modifications.
# More test code. I adjusted line 14 to .47 for some reason .25 didn't work with my sensor. It was a quick cal with hot water and ice water.
# I might change voltage to my fuel tank to 5v.

# works voltage and fuel need values adjusted for your setup
